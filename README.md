# How to Get Your Discord Token From the Browser Console

- Open the browser console with `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`.
- Go to the network tab
- Filter by Fetch/XHR
- Choose a request that isn't an error (if there aren't any, click on a channel or server to trigger some requests.)
- You'll find your discord token under the `request headers` -> `authorization` section. Copy and paste it from there.
